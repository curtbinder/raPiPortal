Reef Angel Custom Portal

Designed to be run on a raspberry pi.
Created using PHP and SQLite3

The files inside this repository are designed to be placed in the /status/ subfolder of the root of your webserver.

To setup properly, inside the Reef Angel libraries you need to make the following changes:

Open RA_Wifi.h
Locate this line:  
        const prog_char BannerGET[] PROGMEM = "GET /status/submitp.aspx?t1=";
Change it to this:
        const prog_char BannerGET[] PROGMEM = "GET /status/submitp.php?t1=";

Save the code and then re-upload your controller code.
Now, whenever you call the ReefAngel.Portal("name"); command, it will query your custom portal instead.


You also need to reconfigure your wifi module to have it redirect to your IP and DNS instead of Reef Angel's.

set ip host XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
set dns name my.domain.name

Where XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is the ip address of your server and my.domain.name is your custom domain name.
